### Completion Instructions

<details>

<summary>Functionality to be added</summary>

<br/>

The app must have the following functionalities

- When the app is opened initially, Home Route should be displayed

- **Home Route**
  - When the Home Route is opened,
    - An HTTP GET request should be made to the **coursesApiUrl**
      - The _loader_ should be displayed while the HTTP request is fetching the data
      - If the HTTP GET request made is successful, then the list of courses received in response should be displayed
      - If the HTTP GET request made is unsuccessful, then the [Failure view](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/tech-era-home-failure-lg-output.png) should be displayed
        - When the **Retry** button is clicked, then an HTTP GET request should be made to **coursesApiUrl**
  - When a course is clicked, then the page should be navigated to the Course Item Details Route
- **Course Item Details Route**
  - When the Course Item Details Route is opened,
    - An HTTP GET request should be made to the **courseDetailsApiUrl** with the `id` as path parameter
      - The _loader_ should be displayed while the HTTP request is fetching the data
      - If the HTTP GET request made is successful, then the course details received in response should be displayed
      - If the HTTP GET request made is unsuccessful, then the [Failure view](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/tech-era-course-details-failure-lg-output.png) should be displayed
        - When the **Retry** button is clicked, then an HTTP GET request should be made to **courseDetailsApiUrl**
- **Not Found Route**
  - When a random path is provided in the URL, then the page should be navigated to the Not Found Route
- When the **website logo** image is clicked, then the page should be navigated to the Home Route

### Important Note

<details>

<br/>

**The following instructions are required for the tests to pass**

- Home Route should consist of `/` in the URL path
- Course Item Details Route should consist of `/courses/:id` in the URL path
- No need to use the `BrowserRouter` in `App.js` as we have already included in the `index.js` file
- Wrap the `Loader` component with an HTML container element and add the `data-testid` attribute value as `loader` to it
- Each course logo image in the Home Route should have the alt as the value of the key "name" from each course object in the courses list
- Each course image in the Course Item Details Route should have the alt as the value of the key "name" in the course details object
- Use `styled-components` for styling elements

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
